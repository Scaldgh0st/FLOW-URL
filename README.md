# Why
I was staying at my mom's house in Kamloops a couple of years ago, and made this.
I don't pretend to know what I did to make the surround for the form here.
I did something crazy with it. It took me several days of sketching, and
building to actually get this operational. Kind of crazy, now that I look at it,
18 months later, and realize that 95% of the time/efforts expended were totally
spent trying to recreate something that I drew. I did it though.
